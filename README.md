# STRUCTURE-PRESERVING-FILTERING-FOR-FUSION-OF-MULTY-PARAMETRIC-MRI-BRAIN-IMAGES
The main aim of this project is to extract salient regions from the different MRI sequences with a low computational complicity. Secondly, the iterative joint filtering approach is implemented in order to perform structure-aware MR image fusion.
